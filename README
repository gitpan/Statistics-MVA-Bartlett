Statistics-MVA-Bartlett version 0.0.4

Bartlett's test ( Snedecor and Cochran, 1983) is used to test if k samples have equal variances. This multivariate form
tests for homogeneity of the variance-covariance matrices across samples. Some statistical tests assume such homogeneity
across groups or samples. This test allows you to check that assumption. See
